# Horiseon Homepage - Challenge, Week One

## Description

The puropose and motivation of this project was to refactor the existing starter code that was given to me. I was able to acheive this by adding semantic structure to the code. I was also able to organize and consolidate elements so that they follow a logical structure that is independent of styling and positioning. In addition, I added elements that will ensure that the webpage meets accessibility standards. 

## Installation

## Usage
This webpage functions and can be used as normal, however, if you inspect the code by using Chrome DevTools you can see that semantic structure that was added to the HTML code. Also, all images and icons have alt attributes so that accessibility devices can be used on the webpage
